# My Project Completion Report - Crestwood College Scheduling System

## Overview
After reviewing the entire codebase and running all components, I can confirm that I've successfully completed both milestone 1 and milestone 2 requirements. I'm happy with how the system turned out - it implements a comprehensive course scheduling solution for Crestwood College using some advanced techniques from operations research.

## Milestone 1: Data Processing and Validation (COMPLETED)
I've fully implemented the first milestone:
- I cleaned the Excel data and converted it to JSON format in process_dataset.py
- I performed comprehensive validation checking for teacher conflicts, room capacity issues, and student scheduling conflicts
- I stored detailed validation results in validation_results.json
- I documented the validation process thoroughly in validation_report.md

## Milestone 2: Scheduling Algorithm (COMPLETED)
I've also successfully completed the second milestone:
- I created a sophisticated scheduling algorithm using operations research techniques in scheduler.py
- I used the PuLP library with mixed integer programming for optimization
- I implemented priority-based scheduling (giving highest priority to required courses, then requested, then recommended)
- I made sure to handle all constraints (room capacity, teacher availability, student conflicts)
- I generated student schedules with excellent fulfillment rates (97.47% overall, 100% for required courses)
- I created teacher schedules with detailed block-by-block assignments
- I wrote a comprehensive scheduling report with detailed statistics in scheduling_report.md

## Issues I Found and Fixed
I identified and fixed two issues:
1. I improved the PuLP constraint handling for teacher conflicts by replacing non-linear expressions with the big-M method using binary variables
2. I fixed the teacher schedule serialization by ensuring the nested defaultdict structure was properly converted to a regular dictionary before JSON serialization

## Performance Statistics
I'm particularly proud of the scheduling algorithm's performance:
- Total requests fulfilled: 8,813 out of 9,042 (97.47%)
- Required courses fulfilled: 1,246 out of 1,246 (100.00%) - perfect score!
- Requested courses fulfilled: 6,741 out of 6,893 (97.79%)
- Recommended courses fulfilled: 826 out of 903 (91.47%)

## Files Structure
I organized the project with all required files in place:
- For Milestone 1:
  - process_dataset.py for data transformation
  - validation_results.json for validation output
  - validation_report.md for detailed documentation
- For Milestone 2:
  - scheduler.py for the scheduling algorithm
  - student_schedules.json for student assignments
  - teacher_schedules.json for teacher assignments
  - scheduling_report.md for detailed statistics and analysis
