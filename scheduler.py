        This implementation will use the Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn-Munkres) to find the optimal assignments

        Transportation and Assignment Problems are well-studied in operations research:
        - The Assignment Problem is about assigning n workers to n jobs optimally
        - The Transportation Problem is about distributing goods from supply centers to demand centers
