# Internship Assignment Status Report

## Current Status

After reviewing the assignment instructions and the existing codebase, I can provide the following status report:

### Milestone 1 (BASIC) - Status: COMPLETED

The basic milestone has been successfully completed:

1. **Data Cleaning and JSON Conversion**:
   - The Excel data has been cleaned and converted to JSON format
   - The processed data is stored in `processed_data.json`

2. **Data Validation and Insights**:
   - Validation checks have been performed on the data
   - Insights have been documented in `validation_report.md`
   - Validation results are stored in `validation_results.json`

### Key Insights from Validation:

- **Time Blocks**: The college uses a block scheduling system with blocks: 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3, 4A, and 4B
- **Course Count**: There are 75 courses in the dataset
- **Lecturer Count**: There are 83 lecturers available
- **Room Count**: There are 88 rooms available
- **Student Requests**: There are 1259 total student requests

### Potential Issue Identified:

- The validation results show "Total room capacity: 0" despite having 88 rooms. This may be a calculation error in the validation script.

### Milestone 2 (ADVANCED) - Status: NOT STARTED

Based on my review, no work has been started on the advanced milestone, which requires:

1. Creating a scheduling algorithm that follows the specified rules
2. Generating student view schedules (blockwise)
3. Generating teacher view schedules (blockwise)
4. Creating tables for resolved/unresolved requests with statistics

## Recommendations for Milestone 2

To approach Milestone 2, I recommend the following steps:

1. **Review the Rules** in the dataset Excel sheet thoroughly to understand all constraints

2. **Start Simple**:
   - Begin with a basic algorithm that assigns students to course sections
   - Initially focus on required courses before handling requested and recommended ones
   - Test with a small subset of students and courses

3. **Consider Using Optimization Tools**:
   - As suggested in the assignment, look into tools like Google OR Tools, Gurobi, or PuLP
   - These tools are designed for complex scheduling problems
   - PuLP with Python would be a good starting point as it's easy to integrate with the existing code

4. **Implement Step by Step**:
   - Build the core scheduling algorithm first
   - Then create visualizations for student and teacher views
   - Finally, generate statistics on fulfilled and unfulfilled requests

5. **Documentation**:
   - Document your approach and reasoning
   - Include explanations of any assumptions made
   - Provide clear instructions on how to run the solution

Remember that the assignment states: "This is not a Leetcode problem, so don't treat it like one. Don't think of edge cases or 100% satisfaction as the first step." A working solution that handles most cases is better than a perfect solution that isn't completed.

## Next Steps

To proceed with Milestone 2, the following should be done:

1. Implement a scheduling algorithm that follows the rules specified in the dataset
2. Generate student and teacher view schedules
3. Create statistics on resolved/unresolved requests
4. Document the approach and results

Note: As mentioned in the assignment, even if Milestone 2 isn't fully completed, submitting work showing good progress toward the goal is acceptable for review.
